Abstract
	Why:
		The rapid development of information technology 
			paved the way for the recording of fine-grained data,
				such as stroke techniques and stroke placements,
					during a table tennis match.
		This data recording creates opportunities to analyze and evaluate matches from new perspectives.
		Nevertheless, the increasingly complex data poses a significant challenge to make sense of and gain insights into.
		However, existing sports visualization methods cannot be applied to visualizing table tennis competitions
			due to different competition rules and particular data attributes.		
	What:
		We collaborate with data analysts 
			to understand and characterize the sophisticated domain problem 
				of analysis of table tennis data.
		We propose iTTVis,
			a novel interactive table tennis visualization system,
				which to our knowledge,
					is the first visual analysis system for analyzing and exploring table tennis data.
		iTTVis provides a holistic visualization of an entire match from three main perspectives, namely,
			time-oriented,
			statistical, and 
			tactical analyses.
		The proposed system with several well-coordinated views 
			not only supports correlation identification through 
				statistics and 
				pattern detection of tactics with a score timeline
			but also allows cross analysis to gain insights.
		Data analysts have obtained several new insights by using iTTVis.
		The effectiveness and usability of the proposed system are demonstrated with four case studies.
			
			
	
1.Introduction
	针对现在的乒乓球数据分析的一些主要趋势及其问题
	
	现有的针对其他运动的可视化的方法不能直接用于乒乓球数据。
	
	设计针对乒乓球数据的可视分析工具存在的挑战
	
	针对这两个跳帧所采取的措施
	
	主要贡献：
		Task
		System
		Case study
	
2.Related Work
2.1.Analysis and Visualization for Table Tennis
	Statistical analysis:
		these measures lack the consideration of game situations.
	
	Mathematical modeling:
		Markov chain
	
	these standard methods lack visualization, leading to the difficulty in interpreting and understanding the results.

3.Background and System Overview
3.1.Background
	乒乓球介绍
	
3.2.Data Description
	数据构成：
		Game ID
		Rally ID
		Stroke ID
		Score A
		Score B
		Stroke player
		Stroke effect	
			5 level
		Stroke technique
			serve
			loop
			quick attack
			smash
			flick
			chop long
			drop shot
			block
			cutting
			parrel

3.3.Requirement Analysis
	背景：
		国家队收集了很多数据，却不能很好的进行分析。
	
	The major milestones of the design process:
		Characterizing problem domains.
		Designing an alpha prototype.
		Re-designing the bata system.
		Enhancing the beta version.
	
	Requirements:
		T: Time-oriented analysis of an entire table tennis match.
			T1: How do the scores evolve over time through a match?
			T2: How can analysts 
					navigate into key rallies on the match timeline and
					explore the transformations of strokes within rallies?				
		S: Statistical analysis of three essential attributes.
			S1: How do stroke attributes intra-related within a stroke?
			S2: How do stroke attributes inter-relate between adjacent strokes?
		C: Cross-analysis between the timeline and statistics.
			C1: How do the timeline and statistics relate to each other?
		P: Pattern mining of tactics in table tennis matches.
			P1: What are the frequent patterns of tactics?
				What are the scoring rates of tactics?
3.4.System Overview
	views of iTTVis
		match view
		stat view
		tactic view
		history view
		stroke view
	
	provide a brief usage scenario to demonstrate how an analyst can use the system.
	
	系统架构：
		后端：node.js
		前端：Angular+d3
		
4.Visual Design
	Three design rationales:
		Use familiar visual metaphors
		Support smooth interactions
		Connect abstract data to the physical context.
		
4.1.Match View
	goal: 
		deliver an overview of the time-varying process and 
		enable multi-level exploration.
	
	description:
		tailored step chart
		point outcome bar
		selection panel
	
	Tailored step chart:
		展示了两个人得分随时间的变化
			x: 时间
			y: 分数
			阴影展示选择的回合
	
	justification:
		Linechart体现的是连续变化，而实际中分数是逐步变化的，因此采用这种设计。
		
	Point outcome bar:
		color: the winning player
		area: the length of the rally
		luminance: the phrase of the rally
	
	Selection panel:
		The gray bar behind each selection encodes the number of rallies that match this selection.
	
4.2.Stroke View
	点击一个回合之后会弹出这个回合的具体信息
	
4.3.Stat View
	Three stroke attributes both
		intra-relate within a stroke and 
		inter-relate between adjacent strokes
	
	how two measure the relationships between these attributes.
	
	Description:
		inter-stroke matrix
		linking stroke attribute
		intra-stroke matrices
	
	Inter-stroke matrix:
		
	Intra-stroke matrix:

5.Case Studies and Discussion
	
6.Conclusion
	This work investigated the problem of visual analysis of table tennis data.
	
	This work has three implications:
